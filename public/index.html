								<h2><a href="#">Welcome to Java Tutor</a></h2>
								<p>An online Java tutorial for CS 201 Students</p>
							</header>
							<p>
								<strong>Hello!</strong> Welcome to Java Tutor, an onine tutorial for <strong>Carleton CS 201</strong> students.
							</p>
							<p>
								 Observe the following "Hello, World!" programs in both Python and Java.
							</p>
							<div id="python_editor_01">
							</div>

							<div id="java_editor_01">
							</div>
							<p>
								It is clear right away that there are some differences between the two. For one, Java requires a bit more code to run than Python does. Don't worry, this code will make sense soon enough.
							</p>
							<p>
								Just as you've seen in Python, Java objects can be separated into "classes". In order for a Java program to run, it MUST be within a class named after the file that contains it. Additionally, you will see that we have defined a main method within this class. A main is required for the compiler to recognize which code it is to run first within the class file. For our purposes, code inside a class will not run unless called upon to do so my the main method, or code run by the main method. There are a few more things to note about the main method, but we'll cover that in a minute! First, Let's get things running!
							</p>
							<p>
								To run a python program, you'll remember, one simply enters: "python program_name.py" and the code will run. In java, it is not that simple. The code must first be compiled into a runnable ".class file". For the helloWorld.java program above this will look like this: "javac helloWorld.java". This program can then be run like so: "java helloWorld". You'll notice that a new file has been created in your working directory. This is the class file that is run by the Java Virtual Machine.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, you'll notice the main method in the helloWorld.java program takes the argument "String[] args". This means that if you want, you can specify arguments to give the program upon running it, and it will interpret them as a list of strings. For example: "java helloWorld test1 test2" would give the main method the list ["test1","test2"] stored in the variable Args. Since we haven't told the main method how to handle any arguments, this will not change how the program runs. But suppose we modified the code to look like the following:
							</p>
							<div id="java_editor_02">
							</div>
							<p>
								This program requires that one argument be entered after "java HelloWorld". Suppose that you entered the world "Bob" as your argument, what would the output look like?

								<h2><a href="#">Creating Objects and Type Declaration:</a></h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								At this point you may have noticed that creating variables in Java is not the same as creating them in Python. You may have also noticed that every statement ends in a semicolon. We'll get back to that later. Java is considered a "strongly typed" language in that it requires all variables to have a specified type upon declaration. For example if one wanted to store a string in a new variable called "name", one would write:
							</p>
							<!-- Text -->
							<section class="box text-style1">
								<div class="inner">
									<p>
										String name = "some string here";
									</p>
								</div>
							</section>
							<p>
								If you wanted to create a variable called "number" to store the integer 1, you would write:
							</p>
							<section class="box text-style1">
								<div class="inner">
									<p>
										int number = 1;
									</p>
								</div>
							</section>
						<p>
							You may look at the Java documentation[add hyperlink] to find a complete list of common object types recognized by Java.
						</p>
						<p>
							Check 1: The following program should add two integers a and b and print the outcome. Fill in the empty or incomplete lines so that it does so.

								<h2><a href="#">Lists and For Loops:</a></h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								An important datatype in java is the array. Declaring an array of integers looks like the following:
							</p>
							<div id = "java_editor_03_1"></div>
							<p>
								What do you think the output would be if we decided to print anArray[7]?

							<p>
								ArrayLists:

								Arrays in Java have some limitations. Namely, they require users to declare their size upon instantiation, or to instantiate them with a given list of items. An array's size in Java is not dynamic like in Python, so they cannot resize themselves when necessary. Java's ArrayList object solves this problem. Read about ArrayLists and how to instantiate them here: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_arraylist_class.htm

								For simplicity's sake we will use ArrayLists throughout the rest of the tutorial.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now, say I want to loop over an arrayList and manipulate its elements. How would I do that? For Loops are the answer! For Loops in Java behave the same as they do in Python but require slightly different syntax. Observe the following side-by-side Python and Java code:
							</p>
							<div id = "python_editor_04"></div>
							<div id = "java_editor_04"></div>
							<p>
								You may notice the curly braces at the start and end of the for loop in Java. This is the equivalent to an indent in Python and can be seen around the code inside a class and method in Java as well. The end curly brace on the signals to the compiler that the "indented section" is over, just as the beginning curly brace signals its beginning.
							</p>
							<p>
								So, how would one loop over an array in Java? The sample code below prints out the strings stored at each index of the array. See if you can figure out how it works:
							</p>
							<div id="java_editor_05"></div>
							<p>
								What would the output be if the code were adjusted to read:
							</p>

							<p>
								    for (i = 0; i < 3; i++){
							</p>
							<p>
								in line 7?
							</p>

								[response]
							<p>
								What will be the printed output of the following program?
							</p>

							<div id="java_editor_06"></div>

								[response]
							<p>
								From the first example, what if we only want to print the elements in the odd indices of the array? Just as in Python, we need the conditional "if" statement to do that.
							</p>
							<div id="python_editor_07"></div>
							<div id="java_editor_07"></div>
							<p>
								Write a program called OneEvenSum.java that is exactly the same as you wrote for part one, but uses the conditional "if" to add only the elements of the array who's indices are divisible by 2. This program should print the resulting integer as output.

								<h2><a href="#">Classes, Objects, Class Methods & Variables:</a></h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								In this section we demonstrate how to write Classes and Objects in Java as you learned to do in Python. Recall that in Python, classes are constructed like so:
							</p>
							<div id="python_editor_02"></div>
							<p>
								In this example, the class is called Person and it has the class variable height. The constructor requires the parameter 'h'. In the constructor, the 'height' variable of the Person object is set to be the value of the parameter h. 'Person' has one function, namely, 'printHeight', which prints the height of the Person object. In the main function we 'instantiate' a Person object called 'guy' with a height of 5 and then print the height of 'guy' using printHeight(). Here is the equivalent code in Java side by side with the python code:
							</p>
							<div id="python_editor_02_1"></div>
							<div id="java_editor_08"></div>
							<p>
								  Take a second to read through and notice some of the syntax differences between the way classes, variables, and functions are declared in Java versus Python.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the Java code above, the constructor is named after the class (i.e. "Person()" instead of "__init__()") and takes only the parameter h, which is an integer. As in Python, at least one constructor must be invoked upon creating a new class object.
							</p>
							<p>
								You may be asking yourself: What's with the words "Public" and "void" in the method declaration? What do they do? "Public" specifies that the method can be called from outside of the class. If the modifier were to instead be "Private", the method could only be accessed from other methods inside the class. The "void" portion is the return type of the method. In this case, the method returns nothing so we specify that its return type be "void". Say for example, your method returned an Integer. We would speficy this keyword to be "Integer". Now, how might we construct an Object from a class?
							</p>
							<p>
								There are three steps when creating an object from a class:<br>
									<br>
									<b>Declaration:</b> A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.<br>
									<br>
									<b>Instantiation:</b> The 'new' key word is used to create the object.<br>
									<br>
									<b>Initialization:</b> The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								Here is some example code for creating a new Person object:
							</p>
							<div id="java_editor_09"></div>
							<p>
								This code creates a Person object named "guy" with a height of 5.
							</p>
							<p>
								Instance variables and methods are accessed via created objects. To access an instance variable the steps are as follows:
							</p>
							<div id="java_editor_10"></div>
							<p>
							This example will walk you through how to access instance variables and methods of a class:
							</p>
							<div id ="java_editor_11"></div>
							<p>
								If we compile and run the program above, what will its output would be? Seperate any linebreaks with a space.<br>
								<br>
								[response]
							</p>
							<p>
								Write a version of Person.java that creates an arrayList of 5 People Objects and sorts them according to height, printing their names from tallest person to the shortest. The people objects should have the following name, height values: (George: 5), (Jen: 6), (Otis: 4}), (Max: 7), (Amy: 8).

								<h2><a href="#">Inheritence, Interfaces and Subclasses</a></h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							Clasees are really cool because they allow you to store data and specify operations that can be performed on that data. What if, however, we want to create an object that utilizes all of the same methods and data of one class, but also store additional data and methods for manipulating that data? In essence, what if we wanted to write a class that inherits all properties from some other class, while at the same time having unique properties of its own? This concept is called Inheritence, and it is at the core of what makes Object Orientation so useful.
						</p>

						<p>
							Subclasses:<br>
							<br>
							The class which inherits properties from another class is called a subclass, while the class whose properties are inherited is known as the superclass. In order to express that we want our class to inherit the properties of another class, we use the "extends" keyword like so:
						</p>
							[Java Example 12]
							<div id ="java_editor_12"></div>
						<p>
							Below is example code to walk you through the creation of a subclass of Person, called Parent.
						</p>

							[Java Example 13]
							<div id ="java_editor_13"></div>
						<p>
							The compiled code will produce the following result:<br>
							<br>
							Name: Mom<br>
					    Height: 6<br>
					    Age: 35<br>
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Superclass reference variable can hold the subclass object, but using that variable you can access only the members of the superclass, so to access the members of both classes it is recommended to always create reference variable to the subclass.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you consider the above program you can instantiate the class as given below as well. But using the superclass reference variable ( person in this case ) you cannot call the method setAge(), which belongs to the subclass Parent.
						</p>
						<p>
							Something to note here is that, while a subclass inhereits all methods, fields, and nested classes of a superclass, it does not inherit its constructor. However, the constructor of a superclass can be invoked from the subclass. This is done using the "super" keyword. If a class is inheriting the properties of another class. And if the members of the superclass have the names same as the sub class, to differentiate these variables we use super keyword like so:<br>
							<br>
							super.variable<br>
							super.method();<br>
							<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							The following program uses the super keyword to call the contructor of the Person class from the Parent subclass.
						</p>
						<div id ="java_editor_15"></div>

							Is-A relationship?

							Has-A relationship?

						<p>
							It is important to note that the only possible way to access an object (Parent) is through a reference variable (mom). A reference variable can be of only one type (in this case Parent). Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed. However, the reference variable can be reassinged to access another object given that that object is of the same type or a subtype of its declared type.
						</p>
						<p>
							Write a program called Child.java, where Child is a subclass of Person. Give Child some attributes and methods
						</p>
						<p>
						Interfaces:<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							An interface is another reference type in Java. Similar to class, it is a collection of abstract methods. A class "implements" an interface in order to inherit the abstract methods of the interface.<br>
							<br>
							An interface looks like this:
						</p>
						<div id ="java_editor_16"></div>
						<p>
							Writing an interface is similar to writing a class. A class describes the attributes and behaviours of an object. An interface just describes behaviours (methods) that a class implements.
						</p>
						<p>
							Think of an interface like a contract. If a class implements an interface, all the methods of the interface need to be defined in the class. If they are not, the class must be declared abstract. More on this here: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_abstraction.htm
						</p>
						<p>
							The following code shows the interface Pet, and its implementation by the class Dog.
						</p>
						<div id ="java_editor_17_1"></div>
						<div id ="java_editor_17_2"></div>
						[example_17 Pet.java]
						[example_17 Dog.java]
						<p>
							The Output of this example will be:<br>
							<br>
							You have fed your dog.<br>
							You ware playing fetch with your dog.<br>
						</p>
